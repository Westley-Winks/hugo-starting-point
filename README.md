# Template for basic portfolio using Hugo

Easy starting point for a Hugo website. No setting up complicated themes and easy to change and modify. Contains scripts for automatically pulling GitHub projects but can also be used for a blog or anything else.

Built using [Goa theme](https://github.com/kaapiandcode/hugo-goa) and some code from [open source Twitter](https://opensource.twitter.dev/).
